However, when attempting to submit the annotations I had made, I ran into lots of error messages of the kind ""TypeError: str should not be of value None"" (or something along these lines) with a stack trace of all the internal function calls being made. This happned even though I checked many times that all fields were filled out. I had to use a seperate browser to avoid this in the end. I think cleaner error handling for this kind of error would be useful for user experience. "

2. Consider developing the tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) to reduce the learning cost and allow non-professionals to complete annotations easily. (if necessary)
3. Try to add an auto-wrapping mechanism or tags that can make annotations easier and more convenient to read. (When long strings are used as annotations, they are not automatically wrapped)
4. Implement a mechanism to check for invalid characters such as spaces in required fields to prevent incorrect input."
